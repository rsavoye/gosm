These XML files are for the ODKAggregator and ODK Collect. These are used with
ODK Collect on Android to collect data on waypoints. Once the data is sent to ODKAggregate, it can be exported as a KML or CSV file.For KML, all the data 
that was entered is in the table if you click on the waypoint. The CSV format
is much easier to parse, so we parse the CSV to make an OSM file for import
into Josm and then upload to OSM.
