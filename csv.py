# This is a simple bourne shell script to convert raw OSM data files into
# pretty KML. This way when the KML file is loaded into an offline mapping
# program, all the colors mean something. For example, ski trails and
# bike/hiking trails have difficulty ratings, so this changes the color
# of the trail. For skiing, this matches the colors the resorts use. Same
# for highways. Different types and surfaces have tags signifying what type
# it is.
